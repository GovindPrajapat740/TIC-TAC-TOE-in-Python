# TIC-TAC-TOE-in-Python
This is a very basic project made by using python . This game can be played by two people at a time. There is a 3 by 3 board. To win the game one must occupy all the three places of a column/row/diagonal. In case of all the places are filled and none of the player is able to cover a row/column/diagonal, the game would be said as draw.
